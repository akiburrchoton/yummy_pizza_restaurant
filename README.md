# Yummy Pizza Restaurant Web Application

<h4>Overview:</h4>

The "Yummy Pizza Restaurant" web application was developed as part of a Software Development  subject assignment in my masterâ€™s program. The objective of this assignment was to apply software requirements analysis, design, and implementation techniques learned during the course.

<h4>Motivation:</h4>

The project aimed to enhance practical understanding of software design and development by creating a system that manages pizza-related data. The focus was on mastering design tools and implementing core functionality using a programming language that was new to me.

<h4>Design and Methodology:</h4>

The project involved several phases, starting with the design phase where I created:
<ul>
  <li>Use Case Diagrams: To outline the functional requirements and interactions.</li>
  <li>Use Case Descriptions: To detail the functionalities and user interactions.</li>
  <li>Class Diagrams: To define the structure and relationships of data entities.</li>
  <li>Sequence Diagrams: To illustrate the flow of operations and interactions within the system.</li>
</ul>

Given the limited course duration, the implementation was focused on **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations. I opted to use Python, leveraging the TKINTER module, to develop the application due to my prior experience with Java and the opportunity to deepen my knowledge of Python.

<h4>Key Features Implemented:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Adding a new pizza into the system</li>
  <li>Searching a pizza</li>
  <li>Updating a pizza into the database</li>
  <li>Deleting a pizza from the database</li>
  <li>Viewing detailed pizza information on a separate page</li>
</ul>

This assignment demonstrated my ability to apply Software Design Principles and effectively use a new programming language to develop a functional system.
