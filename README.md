# Software Development Final Assignment 
<h3>Yummy Pizza Restaurant</h3>

It was an assignment of Software Development subject of my master's. We were taught the software requirements analysis, design and implementation. 

During the design phase I went through and designed these:
<ul>
  <li><i>Use Case Diagram Design</li>
  <li>Use Case Description Writing</li>
  <li>Class Diagram Design</li>
  <li>Sequence Diagram Design</i></li>
</ul>

Based on the design part then we were assigned to develop the system. Since the course time was limited, we were to develop inital scopes only where it covered the CRUD function using database. We were suggested to code either with JAVA or PYTHON. Since I already learnt JAVA in my bachelors, I decided to learn Python in detail and do it using PYTHON. 

Using Python and TKINTER module, I developed the system where the functions were covered: 
<ul>
  <li>Adding a new pizza into the system</li>
  <li>Searching a pizza</li>
  <li>Updating a pizza into the database</li>
  <li>Deleting a pizza from the database</li>
  <li>Showing detail of the pizza in separte page</li>
</ul>
